Hello and welcome to my website! The purpose of this website is to show you who I am and what kind of experience/knowledge I am accumulating over the years. 

About Me
======
My name is Brian Alibashi and I am a Sophmore at Michigan State Univeristy studying Computer Engineering. I chose to pursue this degree because I want to join this field of innovation to help advance the world even more than it is now. I have a special interest in XR development -- Augmented/Virtual Reality devices. My future goals are to join a team that develops XR devices to improve the immersiveness and experience of such devices.
